# Ant Problem

## The Four Ants Problem

There are four ants. Each is standing on a different corner of a square with side length 1. At some point in time, designated `t = 0`, the first ant starts following the second ant, the second and starts following the third ant, the third ant starts following the fourth ant, and the fourth ant starts following the first ant. Each ant walks at a constant speed of one unit length per unit time.

Question: after how long do the ants bump into each other?

## Generalization

This simulation generalizes the problem to a scenario with any number of ants. Their initial positions are then no longer the corners of a square, but rather of any N-gon inscribed in a circle, where N is the number of ants. The side length of the polygon is always 1.

## Simulation Parameters

In the simulation, the sizes are scaled up. The side length of the polygon is 3600 pixels, based on a formulation of the puzzle involving a 1 meter by 1 meter square and ants walking at a speed of 1 meter per hour.
